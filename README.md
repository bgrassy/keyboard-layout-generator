# keyboard-layout-generator

Program which allows user to generate a keyboard layout based on a given string.

To use, open up keyboard_generator.py, and edit the "IMAGE DIRECTORY" code to point to where you want the image to be created. From then, you can just run the code, and it will prompt you for various piees of information which will allow you to run the program. This project is still in its preliminary stages. As such, the code itself is still very messy. However, it is functional. 

# To-do list:

1. Rewrite code to incorporate elements of object-oriented programming such as a keyboard class
2. Allow for better error handling and user input options
3. Write a web application interface with more interactivity
